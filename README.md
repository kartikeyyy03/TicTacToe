# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java! This simple console-based game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other in the classic Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses) board game.



## How to Play

1.) Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2.) Open the project in your preferred Java IDE or compile and run it from the command line.

3.) Run the TicTacToeGame.java file to start the game.
## Game Rules

1.) The game is played on a 3x3 grid.

2.) Player 1 can choose whether to use 'X' or 'O' as their marker, and Player 2 uses the other one as their marker.

3.) Players take turns placing their markers on an empty cell on the board by entering the cordinates of the cell, until either one player wins or the board is full (a draw).

4.) The first player to place three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

5.) If all cells are filled and no player has three markers in a row, the game is considered a draw.
